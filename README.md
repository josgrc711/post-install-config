Next thing you will do is create a virtual machine at portal.azure.com.  When you are creating your VM and you get to the part where you are selecting
a region just make sure the region is not where you currently live.

Once you are done creating the VM you will copy the public IP address and then you will paste it in the remote desktop box.

Once your VM is created and you are inside the VM, you will go to the browser and type in whatismyipaddress.com and
record the IP address, the city, region and country.

Inside the VM you will go to the google search engine and type in download proton vpn.  If your VM was created in a country
that speaks another language other than english you may not be able to understand what you are reading when you go to google,
the best thing to do is to simply go to google on your own pc and download proton VPN that way.  In this particular situation
our VM was created in Dublin, Ireland so we dont need to download proton VPN on our PC we can do it on the VM that was created.

Inside the VM you will create a proton vpn account with username and password and then sign in.

After you sign in you will go to downloads and download Windows on the Proton VPN Clients page.

After Proton VPN has been downloaded you will then sign on into Proton VPN with username and password that you
had created earlier.
